# Competitive Programming Practice Repository

Repository of completed competitive programming practice problems, just for fun. Organized by assignment from [usaco.guide](usaco.guide)'s modules into `introduction`, `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`, and `platinum` folders as well as from Codeforces among others.

`usaco` script allows for quick bootstrapping a new problem with a sample case from file, also cleans src folders. `sampletest` allows for rapid one-time setup testing of `stdin` based problems by caching a sample test in an input file. The command can then be reinvoked continually for debugging purposes.
