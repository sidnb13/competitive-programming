# USACO Practice Repository

Repository of completed USACO practice problems. Organized by assignment from [usaco.guide](usaco.guide)'s modules into `introduction`, `bronze`, `silver`, `gold`, and `platinum` folders.

The `clean` executable Python script simply removes C++ binaries and `[*.in,*.out]` files used to test problem sample cases.
